# solar-jockey

### Devpost Project: https://devpost.com/software/solar-jockey

### Inspiration
- CHICKEN JOCKEY
- Sunflowers follow the Sun

### What it does
- Calculates the optimal orientation of a solar panel based on sensor data. (i.e. panel follows the most light). It then pivots the solar panel to the best position for energy capture.

### How we built it
- We used inverse trigonometry and physics to calculate the position of a light source to orient the system in that direction.

### Challenges we ran into
- At first, we tried to implement too much complexity into the system, forcing us to skip back.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to apply complex mathematical concepts to a functional self-contained unit.

### What we learned
- To not use IR sensors
- To not use 4.0 library
    
### What's next for SOLAR JOCKEY
- World domination
- Fighting the Sun

### Built With
- C
- arduino
